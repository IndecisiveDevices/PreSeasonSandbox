### 🕵️‍♂️ What’s This All About?

Welcome to **FTC Sensors**—because once your robot knows *how* to move, it’s time to teach it *why* and *when*. These lessons introduce your robot’s sixth sense (okay, technically just sensors, but still cool). You’ll learn how to detect colors, measure distances, and make decisions based on what your robot sees and feels. It’s like giving your robot eyeballs and a brain—without the awkward teenage phase.

This course is **recommended** after completing **FTC Movement**, but not required. That said, if your robot can’t even *get* to the spot it needs to sense, maybe give Movement a quick revisit. Just sayin’.

### 🔍 FTC Sensors Courses 1–10

| Course               | Challenge Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 - Color Sense      | Use the color sensor to detect floor colors and choose the correct path.              |
| 2 - Multicolor       | Multiple scenarios—getting to the sensor is priority #1.                              |
| 3 - Tinted Maze      | Navigate a maze with color clues. Can you decode the path?                            |
| 4 - Pattern          | Spot patterns and double-check your wiring—logic matters here!                        |
| 5 - Connection       | Floor wires reveal which walls are active. Read the signs!                            |
| 6 - Navigation       | Solo goal challenge—can your robot adapt to reach the end?                            |
| 7 - Distance Sense   | Meet the distance sensor! React based on how close you are to obstacles.              |
| 8 - Hook             | More distance fun—use your sensor to reach the goal smoothly.                         |
| 9 - Entry & Exit     | Multiple walls, multiple outcomes—expand your logic to handle it all.                 |
| 10 - Multisense      | Time to combine sensors—color + distance = robot genius.                              |

### 💬 Final Notes

This isn’t required work—it’s a chance to level up your robot skills and explore what makes autonomous robots tick. Whether you’re curious, confident, or just here for the cool factor, we’ll help you find the right resources to match your style. And remember: if your robot starts acting like it’s lost in a haunted maze, it might just need a little sensor love (or a Movement refresher).
