# 🤖 Welcome to FTC Sim – Your Robot’s New Playground

### 🚀 What’s This Repo?

This is your launchpad for learning how to program robots using the **FTC Sim** online simulator. Whether you’re just starting out or already making your robot moonwalk, this repo has everything you need to level up your skills.

We’ve recently switched to FTC Sim for a smoother, more reliable experience. It’s intuitive, fun, and packed with built-in tutorials to guide you every step of the way.

### 🧭 Getting Started with FTC Sim

1. Go to [FTC Sim](https://ftcsim.org/#frontpageCourses).
2. Click the **hamburger menu** (yes, it’s called that 🍔) in the top left.
3. Select **Login** and sign up or log in.
4. Choose your course: **FTC Movement** or **FTC Sensors**.
5. Follow the built-in tutorials—they’re like cheat codes for your brain.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Start with [FTC Movement](https://github.com/IndecisiveDevices/PreSeasonSandbox/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/SimulatorLessons/FtcMovement/readme.md). It teaches your robot how to move, which is kind of important if you want it to *get to* the thing it’s supposed to sense. Once you’ve mastered movement, jump into [FTC Sensors](https://github.com/IndecisiveDevices/PreSeasonSandbox/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/SimulatorLessons/FtcSensors/readme.md) to give your robot some superpowers.

### 🛠 Programming Like a Pro

- Start with **Block programming**—drag, drop, and make your robot move.
- Then click **OnBot Java** to convert your blocks into real Java code.
- Select “Yes” when prompted to overwrite.
- Tinker with the Java! Change speed, direction, sleep time—go wild (but not too wild).
- Just don’t mess with the class name `MyFIRSTJavaOpMode`. That line is sacred.

### 📁 What’s Inside This Repo?

This repo is organized into two main folders:

- 🧭 [**FtcMovement**](https://github.com/IndecisiveDevices/PreSeasonSandbox/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/SimulatorLessons/FtcMovement/readme.md): Teaches your robot how to move like it’s got somewhere to be.
- 🕵️‍♂️ [**FtcSensors**](https://github.com/IndecisiveDevices/PreSeasonSandbox/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/SimulatorLessons/FtcSensors/readme.md): Gives your robot the ability to *sense* things—colors, distances, and more.

Each folder contains:

- Starter code
- Java solutions (starting with Course 5 and up)
- Templates to help you build your own robot brain

Coach is racing to upload solutions before you get there. Can you beat Coach to the finish line?

### 💬 Need Help?

This isn’t required homework—it’s a chance to explore, experiment, and have fun. If you’re stuck, confused, or just want to show off your robot’s sweet moves, reach out to Coach via the team website or email.

Whether you’re a coding wizard or just figuring out which way is “forward,” we’ll help you find the right tools and resources to match your style.
