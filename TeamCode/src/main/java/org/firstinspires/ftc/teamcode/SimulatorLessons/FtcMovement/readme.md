## 🛠 FTC Movement Simulator – Intro Lesson Plan  

**Audience**: FTC Team (Grades 6–8)  
**Style**: Learn at your own pace, no pressure, just progress!  
**Coach Contact**: Reach out via the team website or email if you hit a wall (or a virtual one in the maze 😄)

# Summary

This course is all about teaching your robot to *move*, not just sit there looking cool (although it does that too). Whether it’s gliding in a straight line, moonwalking through curves, or pulling off tight turns like a robot ninja, you’ll learn how to command your bot with precision and style. Think of it as Robot Driver’s Ed, minus the awkward parallel parking and judgmental instructor.

As you work through each maze, you’ll go from “Wait, how do I make it go forward?” to “Behold, my glorious code masterpiece!” You’ll start with Block programming (easy peasy), then peek behind the curtain to see how it all translates into Java. And once you hit Course 5, we’ll level up with reusable code—because copy-pasting the same movement 47 times is *so last season*. Let’s get those bots moving like they’ve got somewhere to be!

- This is **recommended**, not required. If you’re busy, overwhelmed, or just not vibing with it, that’s okay.
- If you’re stuck, confused, or curious, **reach out to the coach**. We’re here to help.
- If you’re zooming ahead or want more challenge, we’ll find resources that match your style—videos, games, memes, interpretive dance tutorials (okay, maybe not that last one).

### 🏁 The Race Is On

Hey team! As you kick off **Courses 1–4**, you’ll be flying solo—*Java-style*. That means Coach won’t be dropping code solutions for these early levels (yet!), but don’t panic. You’re in *very* good hands with the built-in **Blocky tutorials**. They’re like GPS for your robot brain—guiding you step-by-step so you don’t end up driving into a virtual wall. Trust the tutorial. It’s got your back.

Starting with **Course 5**, Coach will begin posting Java solutions in the **Preseason Sandbox repository**. The goal? Beat you to the finish line. Your goal? Beat Coach there first. It’s a friendly race, and you’ve got the edge—because you’re awesome and robots listen to you.

If you ever feel stuck, confused, or just want to brag about your robot’s sweet moves, reach out! This isn’t required homework—it’s a chance to explore, experiment, and have fun. Whether you’re a coding wizard or just figuring out which way is “forward,” we’ll find the right tools and resources to help you shine.

Let’s make those robots move like they mean it! 🤖💨

### 🚀 Getting Started: Courses 1–4  

**Goal**: Learn the basics of robot movement using Block programming.  

**How**:

- Launch each course and follow the built-in tutorial.
- Use Blocky to guide your robot through the maze.
- Once you’ve got it working, click **“OnBot Java”** and select **“Yes”** to convert your code.
- Peek at the Java version—see how your blocks turn into real code!
- Try tweaking the Java: change speed, direction, or sleep times. Go wild (but not too wild… we still want the robot to reach the flag).

**Courses**:

| Course | Challenge | Tip |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| 1 - Line | Don’t knock over the tower! | Precision is key. |
| 2 - Rearward | Explore different sections. | Try reverse movement. |
| 3 - Half Moon | Feature showcase. | Experiment with turns. |
| 4 - Arch | Navigate around a wall. | Combine turns smartly. |

### 🧩 FTC Movement Courses 5–10

From here on out, the coach will post example solutions in the **Preseason Sandbox repository**. You can use them to learn, compare, or just admire the elegance of clean code.

#### 🧠 Using Methods

**New Concept**: *Reusable Code* with **Java Methods**  
I decided to start introducing Java Methods in Lesson 5. Why? Because this maze is shaped like a “T” and I'm sure you are starting to notice that you are copying the same exact code over and over again. For this "T" course, it's not a lot. But course 6 is a square maze and 8 is a helix maze. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. For lesson 5,

- Complete the tutorial first. You can do this as Blocky or Java, whichever you are more comfortable with.
- Then, learn how to write methods like `moveForward()` or `turnLeft()` to clean up your code.
- This makes your robot smarter and your code less messy (and less headache-inducing).

By this point, starting with lesson 6, you can probalby start jumping direclty into the Java code if you'd like. The built-in tutorial does not have much guidance from here on out.

| Course        | Challenge                                                                 | Tip                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5 - L         | Navigate a tricky L-shaped path—your old turns might not cut it anymore! | Try sharper turns and experiment with sleep timing.                 |
| 6 - Square    | Tight corridors ahead—like robot bumper cars but less fun if you crash.  | Use precise turns and measure your distances carefully.             |
| 7 - Turn Test | A turning obstacle course—your robot’s agility is on trial.              | Mix turn types and test your angles before committing.              |
| 8 - Helix     | Spiral path alert! Angles matter more than ever.                         | Don’t be afraid to retry—small tweaks can make a big difference.    |
| 9 - Around the World | It’s a circular journey—no passport required.                     | Keep your turns consistent and watch for over-rotation.             |
| 10 - Open Ended | Multiple goals, multiple paths—choose your own robot adventure!        | Plan your route before coding, and try different strategies.        |

Each course builds on the last, so by the time you hit Course 10, you’ll be a robot-wrangling wizard. And remember: if your robot starts acting like it’s had too much coffee, it’s probably a sleep timing issue. 😄
